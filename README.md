# Ursus-Bot-Public

A discord bot for supplying timing information for the Ursus event in MapleStory. This time is fixed and does not change with events as there is no MapleStory Dev API which can provide this information. 
The time will always be event time. 

This application is developed using Node.JS, Nodemon, Discord.Js, YTDL and deployed on Heroku 24/7.

This repo is a copy of the private repo but without private sensitive information, which is stored on a local .env and on heroku for deploymnent.
